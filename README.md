## No-Textbook Study Packs (Best-Guess, Self-Contained)

If you don’t have time to get textbooks, start here. These are concise, self-contained “crash notes” designed to cover likely exam scope fast:

- Economic Analysis: `MGMTEX_405_Economic_Analysis/1_Reading_Materials/crash_notes.md`
- Financial Accounting: `MGMTEX_403_Financial_Accounting/1_Reading_Materials/crash_notes.md`
- Marketing Management: `MGMTEX_411_Marketing_Management/1_Reading_Materials/crash_notes.md`

Recommended use:
- Read the crash notes once end-to-end, then switch to practice problems inside each file.
- For weak areas, pair the crash notes with the longer `study_guide.md` and the `reading_list.md` if you want optional depth.

## Study Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation Building
1. **Read** the `study_guide.md` in each course folder for topic overview
2. **Choose** primary textbook from `1_Reading_Materials/reading_list.md`
3. **Focus** on Priority 1 topics first

### Phase 2: Active Learning
1. **Practice** problems from recommended resources
2. **Upload** materials from `2_Podcast_Materials/` to NotebookLM
3. **Generate** audio summaries for passive learning time

### Phase 3: Exam Preparation
1. **Take** practice exams under timed conditions
2. **Review** formula sheets and frameworks
3. **Focus** on weak areas identified in practice

## How to Use NotebookLM for Audio Learning

1. **Go to** [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google.com/)
2. **Create** a new notebook for each course
3. **Upload** documents from the podcast materials suggestions

5. **Listen** during commute, exercise, or other activities

### Recommended NotebookLM Workflow
- Upload 5-10 related documents per session

- **Week 2:** Practice exams + weak area review

### If You Have 1 Week

## Important Notes

1. **Waiver ≠ Credit Reduction**: Passing waiver exams excuses you from the course but doesn't reduce required MBA units. You'll need to take electives instead.

2. **Strategic Consideration**: Consider whether waiving is beneficial:
   - Pros: More elective flexibility, save time, avoid redundant learning
   - Cons: Miss networking opportunities, may need refresher, professor relationships

3. **CPA Advantage**: If you have a CPA license, definitely waive Financial Accounting to save significant study time.

## Contact for Exam Registration
Remember to email the program administrator by **Wednesday, August 20th at noon** to confirm attendance for the Economic Analysis exam.

## Study Group Formation
Consider forming study groups with other EMBA students preparing for the same exams. Collaborative learning can be highly effective for case analysis and problem-solving practice.

*Good luck with your waiver exams! Remember: These exams test mastery, not just familiarity. Prepare thoroughly and practice under timed conditions.*
