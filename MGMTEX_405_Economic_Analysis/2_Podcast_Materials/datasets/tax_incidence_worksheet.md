## Tax Incidence & DWL Worksheet

1) Linear S/D with specific tax
- Demand: Qd = 100 − 2P; Supply: Qs = −20 + 3P; Tax t = 4 on sellers.
- No tax: 100 − 2P = −20 + 3P → P* = 24; Q* = 52.
- With tax (seller): Qs = −20 + 3(P − t) = −32 + 3P.
- New eq: 100 − 2P = −32 + 3P → Pc = 26.4; Q = 47.2; Ps = 22.4.
- Incidence: Consumers +2.4; Producers −1.6 vs 24. More burden on less elastic side.
- DWL ≈ 0.5 × t × (Q* − Qtax) = 0.5 × 4 × (52 − 47.2) = 9.6.

2) Elasticity-based incidence rule
- If |Ed| < |Es| → consumers bear more tax; if |Ed| > |Es| → producers bear more.

3) Ad valorem tax hint
- For share τ on price, wedge is τ·P; solve with Pbuyer = (1+τ)Pseller in equilibrium.
