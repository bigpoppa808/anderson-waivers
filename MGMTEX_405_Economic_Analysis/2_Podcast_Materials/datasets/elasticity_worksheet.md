## Elasticity Worksheet (with concise answers)

1) Demand elasticity and revenue
- Ed = −1.3; price +10%.
- Approx revenue change ≈ +10% × (1 + Ed) = +10% × (−0.3) = −3% (exact depends on curvature). For small changes: revenue down ~3%.

2) Arc elasticity (midpoint)
- Q1 = 120, P1 = 30; Q2 = 100, P2 = 33.
- %ΔQ = (100−120)/((100+120)/2) = −20/110 = −0.1818; %ΔP = (33−30)/31.5 = 0.0952.
- Ed ≈ −0.1818 / 0.0952 = −1.91 (elastic).

3) Cross-price elasticity
- Q of A rises 6% when price of B up 4% → Exy = +1.5 (substitutes).

4) Income elasticity
- Q up 8% when income up 10% → Ey = +0.8 (normal necessity).

5) Optimal markup (Lerner)
- If Ed = −2, (P−MC)/P = 0.5 → P = 2×MC.

6) Linear demand revenue peak
- P(Q) = a − bQ; MR = a − 2bQ = 0 at Q = a/(2b). Revenue max at midpoint of demand.
