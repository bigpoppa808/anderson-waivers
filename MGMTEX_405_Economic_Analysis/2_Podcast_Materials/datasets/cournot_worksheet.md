## Cournot Equilibrium Worksheet (linear demand, constant MC)

Setup
- Inverse demand: P = a − bQ, Q = q1 + q2, MC1 = MC2 = c (constants).
- Best response for each firm: qi = (a − c − bqj) / (2b).
- Symmetric NE: q1 = q2 = (a − c) / (3b); Q = 2(a − c)/(3b); P = a − bQ.

Exercises
1) a = 100, b = 1, c = 10
- q1 = q2 = (100 − 10)/3 = 30; Q = 60; P = 40.

2) a = 80, b = 2, c = 20
- q1 = q2 = (80 − 20)/(3×2) = 60/6 = 10; Q = 20; P = 80 − 2×20 = 40.

3) Compare to monopoly (same a,b,c)
- Monopoly Qm solves MR=MC: a − 2bQm = c → Qm = (a − c)/(2b); Pm = a − bQm.
- Competition (price-taking) Pc = MC = c → Qc = (a − c)/b; Cournot outcomes: Q between Qm and Qc; P between Pc and Pm.
