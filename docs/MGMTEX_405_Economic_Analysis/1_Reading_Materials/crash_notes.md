# MGMTEX 405 - Economic Analysis: Crash Notes

**Textbook**: Microeconomics by Goolsbee, Levitt & Syverson (3rd Edition)  
**Professor**: Clemence Tricaud  
**Exam Format**: 90 minutes | 30% Midterm, 40% Final, 30% Problem Sets  
**Purpose**: Self-contained notes covering all 8 modules for the waiver exam

## Exam Playbook
- Read every prompt for the economic mechanism (incentives, constraints, tradeoffs)
- Draw a quick graph/table if relevant; label axes and shifts
- Write the decision rule first (e.g., produce where MR = MC) before computing
- When time is tight: identify direction and magnitude qualitatively, then quantify

## Module 1: Economic Way of Thinking & Market Equilibrium

### The Economic Problem
- Scarcity and choice: unlimited wants vs limited resources
- Opportunity cost: value of next best alternative foregone
- Marginal thinking: decisions at the margin (MB = MC)
- Incentives matter: people respond to changes in costs/benefits

### Supply & Demand Fundamentals
- Market equilibrium: Qd(P) = Qs(P) where market clears
- Demand shifters: income, preferences, prices of substitutes/complements, expectations, demographics
- Supply shifters: input costs, technology, expectations, number of producers, regulations
- Movement along vs shift of curves

### Welfare Analysis
- Consumer surplus (CS): area under demand above price
- Producer surplus (PS): area above supply below price  
- Total surplus = CS + PS (maximized at equilibrium)
- Deadweight loss (DWL): lost surplus from market inefficiency

## Module 2: Demand Analysis & Consumer Behavior

### Elasticity Deep Dive
- Price elasticity of demand: Ed = %ΔQ / %ΔP = (dQ/dP) × (P/Q)
- Point vs arc elasticity (midpoint method for large changes)
- Revenue relationship: TR = P × Q
  - If |Ed| > 1 (elastic): ↓P → ↑TR
  - If |Ed| = 1 (unit elastic): TR maximized
  - If |Ed| < 1 (inelastic): ↑P → ↑TR

### Cross-Price and Income Elasticity
- Cross-price elasticity: Exy = %ΔQx / %ΔPy
  - Exy > 0: substitutes (coffee & tea)
  - Exy < 0: complements (cars & gasoline)
- Income elasticity: Ey = %ΔQ / %ΔIncome
  - Ey > 1: luxury good
  - 0 < Ey < 1: normal good (necessity)
  - Ey < 0: inferior good

### Consumer Choice Theory
- Budget constraint: PxX + PyY = Income
- Utility maximization: MUx/Px = MUy/Py (equimarginal principle)
- Income and substitution effects:
  - Normal goods: both effects reinforce
  - Inferior goods: opposing effects
  - Giffen goods: income effect dominates (rare)

## Module 3: Production & Costs

### Production Function
- Total product (TP), average product (AP), marginal product (MP)
- Law of diminishing returns: holding other inputs fixed, MP eventually declines
- Short run vs long run: at least one fixed input vs all inputs variable

### Cost Structure
- Fixed costs (FC): don't vary with output (rent, insurance)
- Variable costs (VC): vary with output (materials, labor)
- Total cost: TC = FC + VC
- Per-unit costs:
  - Average fixed cost: AFC = FC/Q (always declining)
  - Average variable cost: AVC = VC/Q
  - Average total cost: ATC = TC/Q = AFC + AVC
  - Marginal cost: MC = ΔTC/ΔQ = dTC/dQ

### Cost Curve Relationships
- MC intersects AVC and ATC at their minimum points
- When MC < ATC, ATC is falling; when MC > ATC, ATC is rising
- Long run: economies of scale (LRATC falling), constant returns, diseconomies of scale

## Module 4: Perfect Competition & Welfare Analysis

### Perfect Competition Characteristics
- Many buyers and sellers (price takers)
- Homogeneous product
- Free entry and exit
- Perfect information

### Profit Maximization
- Decision rule: produce where MR = MC
- In perfect competition: P = MR (horizontal demand for firm)
- Short-run supply: MC curve above AVC (shutdown point)
- Shutdown condition: if P < AVC, produce Q = 0
- Exit condition (long run): if P < ATC, exit industry

### Long-Run Equilibrium
- Entry/exit until economic profit = 0
- P = minimum ATC (productive efficiency)
- P = MC (allocative efficiency)
- Industry supply more elastic in long run

### Welfare Applications
- Taxes: create wedge between buyer/seller prices
  - Tax incidence depends on relative elasticities
  - DWL = ½ × tax × ΔQ
- Price controls:
  - Ceiling below equilibrium → shortage
  - Floor above equilibrium → surplus

## Module 5: Market Power, Monopoly & Monopolistic Competition

### Monopoly Fundamentals
- Single seller, barriers to entry
- Downward-sloping demand → MR < P
- For linear demand P = a - bQ: MR = a - 2bQ
- Profit max: MR = MC, then find P from demand
- Markup: (P - MC)/P = -1/Ed (Lerner Index)

### Welfare Loss from Monopoly
- Consumer surplus transferred to producer
- Deadweight loss from reduced output
- X-inefficiency: lack of competitive pressure

### Monopolistic Competition
- Many firms, differentiated products
- Short run: can earn economic profits
- Long run: entry → demand shifts left → zero economic profit
- Excess capacity: produce below minimum ATC
- Product variety benefit vs inefficiency tradeoff

## Module 6: Advanced Pricing Strategies

### Price Discrimination Types
- First-degree (perfect): charge each consumer their max WTP
  - Captures all consumer surplus
  - Theoretical benchmark
- Second-degree (nonlinear): quantity discounts, versioning
  - Self-selection mechanism
  - Examples: bulk discounts, software versions
- Third-degree (segmentation): different prices by group
  - Requires: market power, segmentation ability, no arbitrage
  - Higher price for less elastic segment

### Two-Part Tariffs
- Fixed fee + per-unit charge
- Optimal: set P = MC, fee = consumer surplus
- Examples: club memberships, phone plans

### Bundling Strategies
- Pure bundling: only sell as package
- Mixed bundling: individual or package
- Effective when: negative correlation in valuations
- Microsoft Office, cable packages

## Module 7: Oligopoly & Game Theory

### Oligopoly Models
- Few firms, strategic interdependence
- Barriers to entry maintain market structure

### Cournot Competition (Quantity)
- Firms choose quantities simultaneously
- For duopoly with P = a - b(q1 + q2), MC = c:
  - Reaction function: q1 = (a - c - bq2)/(2b)
  - Symmetric equilibrium: q* = (a - c)/(3b)
  - Total output between monopoly and perfect competition

### Bertrand Competition (Price)
- Firms choose prices simultaneously
- With identical products: P = MC (Bertrand paradox)
- With differentiated products: prices above MC

### Game Theory Essentials
- Players, strategies, payoffs
- Dominant strategy: best regardless of others' actions
- Nash equilibrium: mutual best responses
  - No player wants to deviate unilaterally
- Sequential games: backward induction
- Prisoner's dilemma: individual vs collective rationality

## Module 8: Market Failures - Externalities & Asymmetric Information

### Externalities
- Negative externality: social cost > private cost
  - Overproduction relative to social optimum
  - Solutions: Pigouvian tax, regulation, cap-and-trade
- Positive externality: social benefit > private benefit  
  - Underproduction relative to social optimum
  - Solutions: subsidies, public provision
- Coase Theorem: with low transaction costs and clear property rights, private bargaining achieves efficiency

### Asymmetric Information
- Adverse selection (hidden information):
  - Market for lemons problem
  - Insurance markets: sick people more likely to buy
  - Solutions: signaling, screening, mandatory participation
- Moral hazard (hidden action):
  - Post-contract behavior changes
  - Insurance → less careful behavior
  - Solutions: deductibles, monitoring, incentive contracts

### Public Goods
- Non-rival and non-excludable
- Free rider problem → underprovision
- Government provision often necessary

## Key Quantitative Methods

### Break-even and Contribution
- Contribution margin per unit = P - VC
- Break-even Q = Fixed Cost / (P - VC)

### Linear Demand and MR
- If P(Q) = a - bQ, then TR = P·Q = aQ - bQ²
- MR = a - 2bQ

### Cournot Duopoly (symmetric, constant MC)
- Inverse demand P = a - bQ, MC = c
- Each firm's best response: qi = (a - c - bqj)/(2b)
- Symmetric NE: q1 = q2 = (a - c)/(3b)

### Price Discrimination by Segment
- Optimal per-segment rule: choose Qi with MRi(Qi) = MC
- Price Pi from each segment's demand at Qi

## Worked Examples by Module

### Module 1-2: Elasticity & Tax Incidence
- Demand: Qd = 100 - 2P; Supply: Qs = -20 + 3P; Tax t = 4
- No tax: P* = 24, Q* = 52
- With tax: Pc = 26.4, Ps = 22.4, Q = 47.2
- Consumer burden: +2.4; Producer burden: -1.6

### Module 5: Monopoly Pricing
- Demand: P = 60 - Q; MC = 20
- MR = 60 - 2Q = 20 → Q = 20, P = 40
- Profit = (P - MC) × Q = 400

### Module 6: Two-Part Tariff
- 100 consumers, demand P = 10 - Q, MC = 2
- Per-unit price = MC = 2, each consumes Q = 8
- Fee = consumer surplus = 32
- Total profit = 100 × 32 = 3200

### Module 7: Cournot Duopoly
- P = 100 - Q, MC = 10
- Each firm: q = 30, Total Q = 60, P = 40
- Profit per firm = 900

### Module 4: Shutdown Decision
- P = 6, AVC = 7, ATC = 9
- Since P < AVC, shut down
- Loss = Fixed Cost only

### Module 8: Externality Problem
- Factory pollution: Private MC = 20, External cost = 10
- Social MC = 30
- Efficient solution: Pigouvian tax = 10
