## Module 1: Economic Way of Thinking & Market Equilibrium

### Key Concepts
- **Scarcity and Choice**: The fundamental economic problem
- **Opportunity Cost**: Value of the next best alternative foregone
- **Marginal Analysis**: Making decisions at the margin (MB = MC)
- **Market Equilibrium**: Where supply meets demand

### Study Focus
- Understand how to find equilibrium price and quantity
- Practice shifting supply and demand curves
- Calculate consumer and producer surplus
- Identify sources of deadweight loss

### Practice Problems
1. Given demand Qd = 100 - 2P and supply Qs = 20 + 3P, find equilibrium
2. If income increases, how does demand for normal vs inferior goods shift?
3. Calculate CS and PS for a given equilibrium

## Module 2: Demand Analysis & Consumer Behavior

### Key Concepts
- **Price Elasticity of Demand**: Responsiveness of quantity to price changes
- **Cross-Price Elasticity**: Relationship between goods (substitutes/complements)
- **Income Elasticity**: Normal vs inferior goods
- **Consumer Choice Theory**: Utility maximization subject to budget constraint

### Study Focus
- Master elasticity calculations and interpretations
- Understand revenue implications of price changes
- Apply consumer choice theory to real scenarios

### Critical Formulas
- Ed = (dQ/dP) × (P/Q)
- Revenue Test: |Ed| > 1 → elastic; |Ed| < 1 → inelastic
- Optimal consumption: MUx/Px = MUy/Py

## Module 3: Production & Costs

### Key Concepts
- **Production Function**: Relationship between inputs and outputs
- **Diminishing Returns**: Eventually declining marginal product
- **Cost Structure**: Fixed, variable, and marginal costs
- **Economies of Scale**: Long-run cost advantages

### Study Focus
- Distinguish between short-run and long-run costs
- Understand relationship between MC, AVC, and ATC
- Identify optimal production levels

### Key Relationships
- MC intersects AVC and ATC at minimum points
- ATC = AFC + AVC
- Long run: all inputs variable

## Module 4: Perfect Competition & Welfare Analysis

### Key Concepts
- **Perfect Competition**: Many firms, homogeneous product, price takers
- **Profit Maximization**: P = MR = MC
- **Shutdown Decision**: P < AVC → shut down
- **Long-Run Equilibrium**: Zero economic profit, P = min ATC

### Study Focus
- Determine firm's supply curve
- Calculate producer and consumer surplus
- Analyze welfare effects of taxes and price controls

### Welfare Applications
- Tax incidence depends on relative elasticities
- DWL from market interventions
- Efficiency vs equity tradeoffs

## Module 5: Market Power, Monopoly & Monopolistic Competition

### Key Concepts
- **Monopoly**: Single seller, barriers to entry, MR < P
- **Profit Maximization**: MR = MC, then find P from demand
- **Deadweight Loss**: Social cost of monopoly
- **Monopolistic Competition**: Differentiated products, zero long-run profit

### Study Focus
- Calculate monopoly price and quantity
- Compare to competitive outcome
- Understand sources of market power

### Key Formula
- Linear demand P = a - bQ → MR = a - 2bQ
- Lerner Index: (P - MC)/P = -1/Ed

## Module 6: Advanced Pricing Strategies

### Key Concepts
- **Price Discrimination**: First, second, and third degree
- **Two-Part Tariffs**: Fixed fee + per-unit price
- **Bundling**: Selling products together
- **Versioning**: Different quality levels

### Study Focus
- Identify conditions for successful price discrimination
- Calculate optimal two-part tariff
- Understand when bundling increases profit

### Applications
- Airlines, software, telecommunications
- Theme parks, clubs, utilities
- Microsoft Office, cable packages

## Module 7: Oligopoly & Game Theory

### Key Concepts
- **Strategic Interdependence**: Firms consider rivals' reactions
- **Cournot Competition**: Quantity competition
- **Bertrand Competition**: Price competition
- **Nash Equilibrium**: Mutual best responses

### Study Focus
- Solve for Cournot equilibrium quantities
- Find Nash equilibria in simple games
- Apply backward induction to sequential games

### Key Models
- Cournot: qi = (a - c)/(3b) for symmetric duopoly
- Prisoner's Dilemma: Individual vs collective rationality
- Entry deterrence and credible threats

## Module 8: Market Failures

### Key Concepts
- **Externalities**: Costs/benefits not reflected in market price
- **Public Goods**: Non-rival, non-excludable
- **Asymmetric Information**: Adverse selection, moral hazard
- **Solutions**: Taxes, subsidies, regulation, property rights

### Study Focus
- Calculate socially optimal output with externalities
- Understand Coase Theorem applications
- Identify information problems in markets

### Policy Applications
- Pigouvian taxes for pollution
- Insurance market failures
- Education as positive externality

## Exam Strategy

### Time Management (90 minutes)
- 5 minutes: Read all questions, plan approach
- 60-70 minutes: Answer problems methodically
- 10-15 minutes: Review and check work
- 5 minutes: Final review

### Problem-Solving Approach
1. Identify the economic concept being tested
2. Draw relevant graphs if helpful
3. Write down the key formula or decision rule
4. Show all work clearly
5. Check answer for economic intuition

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Confusing movements along vs shifts of curves
- Forgetting to check second-order conditions
- Missing units in elasticity calculations
- Confusing short-run vs long-run analysis

## Key Formulas Summary

### Elasticity

- Cross: Exy = (dQx/dPy) × (Py/Qx)
- Income: Ey = (dQ/dI) × (I/Q)

### Costs
- TC = FC + VC
- ATC = TC/Q = AFC + AVC
- MC = dTC/dQ

### Market Structures
- Perfect Competition: P = MR = MC
- Monopoly: MR = MC, P from demand
- Cournot: qi = (a - c - bqj)/(2b)

### Welfare
- CS = ∫[P_max to P*] Qd(P) dP
- PS = ∫[P* to P_min] Qs(P) dP
- DWL = ½ × tax × ΔQ
